Am I crazy? At this point in my life?  Why would I even think about doing this?  Something that has always been so foreign to me that I stayed away like it was the plague.  Well, I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could learn something new...you know keep the brain cells tingling.  I studied html on my own and took a liking to it and thought..."Hey, I can do this."...Then I started Ruby at Flatiron.....ummm....

Yes, I want to do web development/coding for companies and even start my own tech company that benefits humanity...financially.  You know, be the entrepreneur living that plush life.  However, I somehow forgot that my father was an entrepreneur and it was anything but plush.  It seemed plush because I didn't do the work.  I went to school, went to piano classes, and dreamed about being a pop star in my little room.  I had no clue the work my father put in as an entrepreneur that benefitted his immigrant community.  

To many, because my father didn't make millions, he wasn't a success.  However, if you knew where he came from and how he did it all by himself...he was a success.  He is in a line or 2 in a history book somwhere about his contribution to his community.  Yes, I'm proud.

I'll be proud of myself when I get through this next lab assignment without asking for help.  Such is life.
